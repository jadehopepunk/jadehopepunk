description: Learn more about my background and experience.
---

I live in Merri-bek, on the unceded lands of the [Wurundjeri](https://www.wurundjeri.com.au/) Woiwurrung people of the Kulin nation.

This website provides a place to connect with me, primarily for collaborating with me on my interests and projects, many of which currently center around social change in my local community.

## Who am I?

My pronouns are **he/him** or **they/them**.

I'm 44 years old, and benefit from just about every type of privilege available in Australian society, including being white, male, affluent, non-disabled.

I'm also openly sex-positive, queer, an practicing relationship anarchy. As this site describes my interest projects outside of my professional work, it's important to me to be seen as my whole self in those areas.

## My Experience

My change-making experience is informed by my background, which includes:

* 25 years experience as a software engineer
* 15 years experience living in intentional communities, including [Earthsong Eco-Neighbourhood](https://www.earthsong.org.nz/), [Atamai Ecovillage](https://www.facebook.com/atamaivillage/), [The Embassy Network](https://embassynetwork.com/) and [Mojo Manor](/projects/mojo-manor).
* A long involvement with [Enspiral](https://www.enspiral.com/), including representing our current "Kumara" node in the APAC region.
* 5 years with Cogent, a values based consultancy, through which I helped build infrastructure for electric cards, mental health and renewable power.
* 20 years experience as an amateur furniture maker, taught by some great teachers
* A long involvement in sex positive communities, including being a founding member of [PolyVic](https://www.facebook.com/groups/66151944865/)

And most importantly, a long history of fuckups, failures and abandoned projects.

## Let's Connect

You can [contact]({{< ref "contact" >}}) me at any time for a chat. I'm keen to meet local change-makers and organisations, people interested in any of my projects, or needing help with projects of their own.
